# define a function "swap_matrices" that takes two 3x3 matrices("matrix1" and "matrix2") as input

def swap_matrices(matrix1, matrix2):

    # perform the swap
    # we use two cycles to go through each element of the matrices.
    
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):

    return matrix1, matrix2

    # after performing the swap, we return the swaped matrices


# Example:

matrix1 = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

matrix2 = [
    [10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18]
]

# Perform the swap

swapped_matrix1, swapped_matrix2 = swap_matrices(matrix1, matrix2)

for row in swapped_matrix1:
    print(row)
print("\nMatrix 2 after swapping:")
for row in swapped_matrix2:
    print(row)

# We call the "swap_matrices" function with two matrices as arguments and store the swapped matrices in variables "swapped_matrix1" and "swapped_matrix2".
# The swap_matrices function cyclically swaps the contents of two 3x3 matrices by swapping corresponding elements in each row.
# After the swap, the function returns the modified matrices.
# The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the swapped matrices.
