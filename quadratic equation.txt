# The program first takes the coefficients a, b, and c from the user.
# It then calculates the discriminant and checks its value to determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.
# If the discriminant is positive, it calculates two real and distinct roots using the quadratic formula.
# If the discriminant is zero, it calculates two real and identical roots.
# If the discriminant is negative, it does not solve the equation as it has complex roots.
# Finally, it prints the roots of the quadratic equation.
