# define a function "gcd" (greatest common divisor) that takes two numbers as an input

def gcd(a, b):

    # the euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly replacing the larger number by the reminder
    # of dividing the larger number by the smaller number, until one of the numbers becomes zero
    # the other number at this point gcd
    
    while b != 0:
        a, b = a % b

        # the while cyclus continous as long as "b" is not zero.
        # inside the cycle,  "a" is updated to the value of "b", and "b" is updated to the reminder of "a" divided by "b" (a % b)
    
    return a

    # once the cycle exist, "a" contains the GCD of the original two numbers.

# example:

num1 = 48
num2 = 18

gcd_result = gcd(num1,num2)
print("the greatest common divisor of" , num1 , "and", num2 , "is: ", gcd_result )

# start with two numbers "a" and "b"
# replace "a" with "b" and "b" with "a % b"
# repeat until "b" becomes" "0"
# the value of "a" at this point is the GCD
