    [5, 6, 7, 8],

    [13, 14, 15, 16]

# we go trough each element of the matrix and check if it is on the perimeter (first or last row, or first or last column)
# if the element is on the perimeter, we add its value to the sum.
# after going through all elements, we return the sum, which represents the sum of numbers around the perimeter of the matrix.
