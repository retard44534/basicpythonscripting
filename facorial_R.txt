# define a function "factorial" that takes a non-negative integer n as input

def factorial(n):

    # if n is equal to 0 or 1, we return 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1
    # this serves as the condition for the recursion

    if  n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1

    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
    # this is the recursive step.
    # if n is greater than 1, we recursivelly call the "factorial" function with n-1 as the argument
    # we multiply the result of the recursive call by n to get the factorial of n 

    return result

    # after the recursion , we return the factorial of n 

# example:

n = 5
result = factorial(n)
print("the factorial of ", n, "is: ", result)

# the "factorial" function calculates the factorial of non-negative integer recursivelly
# if n is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 as the base case.
# otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n-1 and multiplies the result by n to calculate the factorial of n
