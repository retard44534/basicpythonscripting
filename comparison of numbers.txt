# 1. we define a function that will take three numbers as input 

def compare_three_numbers(a, b, c):

    # assume that  the first number is the largest and then compare it with the other numbers

    largest = a 

    # compare the first number with the second number
    # we check if the second number is greater than the current largest number. if it is we update the largest number.
    
    if b > largest:
        largest = b 

    # compare the largest number with the third number
    # we then check if the third number is greater than current largest number. if it is, we update the largest number.

    if c > largest:
    largest = c

    # finally we return the largest number.

    return largest

# example:
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
num3 = 15

largest_number = compare_three_numbers(num1, num2, num3)
print("The largest number is: ", largest_number)

# we define 3 numbers
# we call the "compare_three_numbers" function with these numbers.
# the function compares the numbers and returns the largest one
# we print the largest number
