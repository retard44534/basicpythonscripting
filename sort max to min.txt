# define a function "sort_max_to_min" that takes a list of five numbers as input

def sort_max_to_min(numbers):

    # check if the list contains exactly five numbers and return "None" if it does not.

    if len(numbers) != 5:
    return None

    # bubble sort algorithm

        for j in range(0,n - i - 1):

# example:
numbers = [3 , 1, 4, 1, 5]

sorted_numbers = sort_max_to_min(numbers)
print("the sorted list from max number to min number is: ", sorted_numbers)

# bubble sort:
# we use two cycles
# The outer loop runs from 0 to n (the length of the list).
# The inner loop runs from 0 to n - i - 1.
# Inside the inner loop, we compare adjacent elements
# If the current element (numbers[j]) is smaller than the next element (numbers[j + 1]), we swap them.
# This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted in max to min order.
